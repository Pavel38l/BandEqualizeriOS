# Band equalizer using AVAudio library for iOS / Swift


## Description
This repository contains an implementation of equalizer bands using the AVAudio library.

For testing, we used the generated music file [sample.mp3](EqualizerEffect/Music/sample.mp3) containing sinusoidal signals of 4 frequencies 250, 500, 1000, 2000 Hz.

By increasing or decreasing slider sound level values of the corresponding frequencies, you can check the operation of the equalizer.

The signal is played automatically when the application starts.
